\item Note: All three cases involved Black individuals, highlighting documented racial bias in face recognition systems \cite{buolamwini2018gender,grother2019frvt}. In each case, the lack of explainable and validated attributions prevented timely detection of the algorithmic error \cite{nrc2009strengthening}.
