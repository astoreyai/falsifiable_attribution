\begin{tabular}{clp{2.5cm}p{2.5cm}p{2.8cm}p{4.2cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Exp ID} & \textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Datasets} & \textbf{Methods Tested} & \textbf{Metrics} & \textbf{Expected Outcome} \\
\midrule
1
& Baseline sanity checks: verify methods respond to model parameters and data
& LFW (1,000 pairs), CelebA (1,000 pairs)
& Grad-CAM, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, LIME
& Edge detector correlation, randomization test (Adebayo et al. 2018 protocol)
& All methods pass basic validation (attributions change when model randomized) \\
\midrule
2
& Ground truth validation: test on known facial attributes
& CelebA with attribute labels (Glasses, Beard, Makeup, Young)
& Grad-CAM, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, LIME
& Attribution accuracy: top-k features overlap with ground truth attribute regions
& Methods correctly identify 70\%+ of known attributes (e.g., Grad-CAM highlights glasses region when present) \\
\midrule
3
& Counterfactual prediction: core falsifiability test
& LFW (1,000 pairs), CelebA (1,000 pairs), CFP-FP (500 pairs for pose variation)
& Grad-CAM, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, LIME
& Correlation $\rho$ ($|\phi|$ vs. $\Delta$-score), p-value, separation $\bar{d}_{\text{high}} - \bar{d}_{\text{low}}$, LPIPS (perceptual quality), FID (distribution shift)
& Grad-CAM passes ($\rho > 0.70$, $p < 0.05$), SHAP/LIME/IG partially pass or fail (lower $\rho$, higher p-value) \\
\midrule
4
& Demographic bias analysis: test fairness across subpopulations
& FairFace (stratified by race/gender/age)
& Best method from Exp 3 (likely Grad-CAM)
& Correlation $\rho$ by demographic group, failure rate by group
& Identify failure modes (e.g., lower $\rho$ for certain demographics), inform deployment warnings \\
\midrule
5
& Convergence validation: test Algorithm 3.1 theoretical guarantees
& LFW (500 images), CelebA (500 images)
& Algorithm 3.1 (counterfactual generator)
& Convergence rate, mean iterations, success rate (98.4\% expected), final distance error
& $>$95\% convergence within 100 iterations, validates Theorem 3.6 existence guarantee \\
